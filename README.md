## Small Power BI project
Using Power Query and Power BI I created some visualizations to merge into a dashboard to evaluate the performance of the open stores of a business and to identify the locations that have the best potential to invest 
more funds into marketing.
For that, I  cleaned and connect the data, created a few Measures using DAX and created the visuals with the appropriate filters and characteristics for them to be helpful and easy to understand
